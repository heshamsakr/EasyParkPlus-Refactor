# `EasyParkPlus-Refactor`

## 🅿️ Project Overview

This repository showcases a comprehensive **Software Design & Architecture (SDA) Project** for **EasyParkPlus**, transforming a basic parking lot prototype into a scalable, enterprise-grade system. By applying advanced software engineering principles, we demonstrate how to evolve legacy code into a robust, maintainable architecture that supports multi-facility operations and innovative EV charging features.

### Key Achievements
- **Code Refactoring Excellence**: Implemented Factory and Observer patterns to eliminate anti-patterns, improving code reusability, maintainability, and adherence to SOLID principles.
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Mastery**: Modeled complex business domains with 8 bounded contexts and 12 aggregates, ensuring alignment with real-world requirements through strategic design and ubiquitous language.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Proposed a microservices-based solution with event-driven communication, supporting seamless expansion to multiple facilities while integrating cutting-edge features like OCPP 2.0.1-compliant EV charging and smart grid capabilities.
- **Business Impact**: Designed for MVP launch in March 2026, targeting 70% parking occupancy and 50% charger utilization, with a focus on user experience, real-time operations, and data-driven insights.

This project exemplifies best practices in software evolution, from anti-pattern removal to strategic architecture design, providing a blueprint for scaling parking management systems in a competitive market.

## 📋 Detailed Rubric Requirements Fulfillment

This section provides detailed mapping of our implementation to the official project rubric requirements:

### **Rubric Requirement 1-2: Design Pattern Implementation & Documentation** ✅

**Requirement**: "Design and code improvements appropriately use two relevant design patterns" + "Written report is detailed and documents changes made"

**Implemented Pattern 1: Factory Pattern**
- **Location**: `02_Refactored_App/parking_manager/Vehicle.py` (lines 102-130)
- **Purpose**: Centralizes and abstracts vehicle object creation logic
- **Benefits**: Eliminates code duplication, supports extension without modification (Open/Closed Principle)
- **Implementation**: `VehicleFactory.createVehicle()` method handles ElectricVehicle and RegularVehicle instantiation
- **Compliance**: Adheres to SOLID principles, specifically Open/Closed and Dependency Inversion

**Implemented Pattern 2: Observer Pattern**
- **Location**: `02_Refactored_App/parking_manager/ParkingLot.py` (lines 3-50)
- **Purpose**: Enables real-time notifications when parking lot state changes
- **Benefits**: Decouples state management from notification logic, supports multiple observers (email, SMS, dashboard)
- **Implementation**: `ParkingObserver` interface with update() method, multiple concrete observers can subscribe
- **Compliance**: Adheres to SOLID Single Responsibility and Dependency Inversion principles

**Written Justification**:
- **Document**: `01_Baseline_Code/Aessesment/REFACTORING_ASSESSMENT.md` (319 lines)
- **Content**: Before/After code comparisons, detailed pattern justification, OO principles analysis (SOLID), design decisions

## 🔧 AI Tools Usage Disclosure

In accordance with Quantic School's academic integrity policy, we disclose the following AI tool usage in this project:

### Overview of AI Tools Employed

The EasyParkPlus-Refactor project leveraged AI tools as enhancement and organizational assistants during the development and documentation phases. These tools were used to support team collaboration, organize complex documentation, and clarify business requirements—not to replace original engineering analysis and decision-making.

### Tools Used
- **ChatGPT (OpenAI)**: Used to simulate conversations with "Michael, Technical Manager" (as specified in project requirements) to gather business requirements and clarify technical details during the Domain-Driven Design discovery phase
- **OpenCode Terminal (opencode.ai)**: Used as a development assistant to organize project structure, format documentation, and ensure consistency across bounded contexts and domain models

### Scope of AI Tool Usage

**Applied to**:
- Requirement elicitation conversations (15 technical questions + 10 architecture questions)
- Documentation organization and formatting across DDD artifacts
- Code refactoring assistance and pattern implementation guidance
- README and documentation structure planning

**NOT Applied to** (All Original Work):
- Strategic decisions on bounded context boundaries
- Identification of aggregates and their relationships
- Business rules and domain event specifications
- Integration patterns between bounded contexts
- MVP phasing strategy and roadmap
- Design pattern selection and implementation decisions
- Anti-pattern identification and severity assessment
- UML diagram design and architectural decisions
- Microservices architecture design

### Quality Assurance

All AI-generated content, suggestions, and organizational aids have been:
1. **Reviewed and validated** against project requirements and specifications
2. **Adapted and modified** to fit the specific context of EasyParkPlus
3. **Integrated** with team's original analysis and engineering decisions
4. **Verified** for accuracy and appropriateness for academic submission

The team takes full responsibility for all deliverables and the accuracy of all technical content. AI tools enhanced productivity and organization but did not replace rigorous software engineering analysis and design thinking. For comprehensive AI usage disclosure, refer to `05_Final_Report/Hesham_Mihai_HaVu_Software Design_EasyParkPlus_Report_V1.0.pdf`.
