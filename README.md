# `EasyParkPlus-Refactor`

## üÖøÔ∏è Project Overview

This repository showcases a comprehensive **Software Design & Architecture (SDA) Project** for **EasyParkPlus**, transforming a basic parking lot prototype into a scalable, enterprise-grade system. By applying advanced software engineering principles, we demonstrate how to evolve legacy code into a robust, maintainable architecture that supports multi-facility operations and innovative EV charging features.

### Key Achievements
- **Code Refactoring Excellence**: Implemented Factory and Observer patterns to eliminate anti-patterns, improving code reusability, maintainability, and adherence to SOLID principles.
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Mastery**: Modeled complex business domains with 8 bounded contexts and 12 aggregates, ensuring alignment with real-world requirements through strategic design and ubiquitous language.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Proposed a microservices-based solution with event-driven communication, supporting seamless expansion to multiple facilities while integrating cutting-edge features like OCPP 2.0.1-compliant EV charging and smart grid capabilities.
- **Business Impact**: Designed for MVP launch in March 2026, targeting 70% parking occupancy and 50% charger utilization, with a focus on user experience, real-time operations, and data-driven insights.

This project exemplifies best practices in software evolution, from anti-pattern removal to strategic architecture design, providing a blueprint for scaling parking management systems in a competitive market.

## üìã What Has Been Implemented

This section maps our completed work to the project rubric requirements:

## üîß AI Tools Usage Disclosure

In accordance with Quantic School's academic integrity policy, we disclose the following AI tool usage in this project:

### Mihai Chindri»ô (DDD Lead)
**Tools used**:
- **ChatGPT (OpenAI)**: Used to simulate conversations with "Michael, Technical Manager" (as specified in project requirements) to gather business requirements and clarify technical details for the Domain-Driven Design phase
- **OpenCode Terminal (opencode.ai)**: Used as a development assistant to organize DDD documentation, structure bounded contexts, and format domain models based on the gathered requirements

**Scope**:
- ChatGPT was used to ask 15 technical and business questions (Round 1) and draft 10 architecture questions (Round 2) to understand system requirements
- OpenCode was used to structure the DDD analysis, organize documentation files, and ensure consistency across bounded contexts and domain models
- **All domain modeling decisions, bounded context identification, and architectural analysis represent original thought** based on project context and Michael's answers
- AI tools served as **enhancement tools for organization and formatting**, not as replacement for original analysis

**What was NOT AI-generated**:
- Strategic decisions on bounded context boundaries
- Identification of aggregates and their relationships
- Business rules and domain events
- Integration patterns between contexts
- MVP phasing strategy

### Ha Vu (Code Implementation Lead)
**Tools used**: [To be documented by Ha Vu]

### Hesham Sakr (Architectural Lead)
**Tools used**: [To be documented by Hesham]

**Note**: All AI-generated content has been reviewed, validated, and adapted to fit the specific requirements of the EasyParkPlus system. The team takes full responsibility for the accuracy and appropriateness of all submissions.
