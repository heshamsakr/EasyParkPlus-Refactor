## Additional Questions for Michael (Round 2)

### Hesham May Need These for Microservices Architecture:

#### Architecture & Deployment Questions:

**Q16: Database Strategy**
- Should each microservice have its own database, or can we use shared schemas?
- What database technologies are approved (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis)?
- Any constraints on database licensing or cloud provider?

**Q17: Inter-Service Communication**
- Preference for synchronous (REST/gRPC) vs asynchronous (message queues)?
- Should we use an API Gateway or allow direct service-to-service calls?
- Any existing message broker infrastructure (RabbitMQ, Kafka)?

**Q18: Authentication & Authorization**
- Centralized authentication service or per-service auth?
- Token-based (JWT) or session-based authentication?
- How should API keys for third-party integrations be managed?

**Q19: Service Scalability**
- Expected traffic patterns (requests per second per facility)?
- Auto-scaling requirements (Kubernetes, AWS ECS)?
- Acceptable latency targets (p50, p95, p99)?

**Q20: Monitoring & Observability**
- Logging infrastructure (ELK stack, CloudWatch)?
- Distributed tracing (Jaeger, Zipkin)?
- Alerting system (PagerDuty, Slack)?

#### Business Logic Questions:

**Q21: Payment Processing**
- Which payment gateway (Stripe, Square, PayPal)?
- Support for multiple payment methods (credit card, mobile wallet, fleet accounts)?
- PCI compliance requirements?

**Q22: Data Retention & Privacy**
- How long should parking/charging session data be retained?
- GDPR/CCPA compliance requirements for user data?
- Data anonymization needs for analytics?

**Q23: Third-Party Integrations**
- Integration with existing systems (accounting, CRM)?
- APIs for mobile app (native iOS/Android)?
- Web portal for facility managers?

**Q24: Disaster Recovery**
- RTO (Recovery Time Objective) if primary facility fails?
- RPO (Recovery Point Objective) - acceptable data loss window?
- Backup strategy (real-time replication, nightly backups)?

**Q25: Multi-Facility Coordination**
- Should subscriptions sync in real-time across facilities?
- Cross-facility reporting requirements (consolidated vs per-site)?
- Shared user accounts or facility-specific accounts?

## What's Left Before Hesham Can Start?

### ✅ Ready for Hesham NOW:
1. **Bounded context diagram** - defines service boundaries
2. **Domain models** - defines aggregates → microservices mapping
3. **Ubiquitous language** - defines API terminology
4. **Michael's Q&A** - clarifies business requirements

### ⚠️ Optional but Helpful:
- Answers to Round 2 questions (Q16-Q25) above
- UML redesign diagrams (not blocking, but helpful for API design)

### ❌ Hesham Should NOT Wait For:
- Final submission package
- README updates
- Additional Michael questions (can ask during architecture design)

---

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (Today/Tomorrow):

1. **Mihai**: Ask Michael Round 2 questions (Q16-Q25) focusing on:
   - Database strategy (Q16) - CRITICAL for microservices
   - Inter-service communication (Q17) - CRITICAL for architecture
   - Payment gateway (Q21) - Needed for Billing service API design

2. **Ha Vu**: Create 2 redesign UML diagrams:
   - **Class Diagram**: Show Factory + Observer pattern implementation
   - **Sequence Diagram**: Show parking session flow with patterns

3. **Hesham**: Start microservices architecture design (can begin NOW):
   - Map 8 bounded contexts → microservices
   - Define service responsibilities
   - Design APIs (external + inter-service)
   - Define database per service

### This Week:

4. **Mihai**: Update README.md with:
   - Current project status
   - Completed DDD work
   - Team accomplishments

5. **Team**: Review and finalize all documentation

### Next Week:

6. **Hesham**: Complete microservices architecture diagram
7. **Hesham**: Compile final submission .zip package
8. **Team**: Final review before submission

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Missing redesign UML | HIGH | Ha Vu creates this week (2-3 hours work) |
| Microservices diagram incomplete | HIGH | Hesham can start now with existing DDD docs |
| Hesham blocked waiting | MEDIUM | Mihai gets Q16-Q17 answers ASAP (database + communication) |
| Tight timeline (5 months to MVP) | MEDIUM | Accept technical debt, document for Phase 2 |
| Missing Michael answers | LOW | Can proceed with reasonable assumptions |

## Summary: Are We On Track?

### Score 5 Requirements Progress: 9/12 Complete (75%)

**✅ Solid Foundation (7 complete):**
- Code refactoring with patterns
- Anti-pattern identification & fixes
- DDD documentation (bounded contexts, domain models, ubiquitous language)
- Source code and screenshots

**⚠️ In Progress (1 partial):**
- Original UML diagrams (need verification)

**❌ Critical Path Items (3 missing):**
1. Redesign UML diagrams (Ha Vu - HIGH PRIORITY)
2. Microservices architecture (Hesham - HIGH PRIORITY)
3. Final submission package (Hesham - after #1 and #2)

### Confidence Level: 🟢 HIGH

**Why we're confident:**
- DDD work is **excellent** (exceeds expectations)
- Code refactoring is **complete and high-quality**
- Only 2 deliverables blocking submission (UML redesign + microservices)
- Hesham can start microservices work **immediately** (not blocked)
- Ha Vu's UML diagrams = 2-3 hours work (low risk)

**Timeline to completion:**
- UML redesign: 2-3 hours (Ha Vu)
- Microservices architecture: 4-6 hours (Hesham)
- Final packaging: 1-2 hours (Hesham)
- **Total**: 7-11 hours of work remaining

**Estimated completion date**: October 26-27, 2025 (3-4 days)

**Status**: DDD phase complete, ready to proceed with architecture design and final UML diagrams.
